Example code for a Javascript challenge that I created


The challange was to create a JavaScript program that would take a pyramid array and a decode file and determine the encypted message.

1. Load the DecodeMsg.js file into Visual Studio Code.
2. Modify the path to point to the DecodeMessage.txt file.
3. Run to get the final decoded message "I love computers".

The demo shows proficiency in handling pyramid type arrays. Ex. [[1],[2,3],[4,5,6]]
Pulling the last number from each elemenet we get the decode list of 1,3,6.

The rest of the code 
1. Loads the DecodeMessage.file.
2. Rearrage the incoming file into an array where the value, ex. Apple 1 is parsed into an array like [1,'Apple']...
3. Using arrays and foreach we are able to search for each of the messages by key value.
4. Output the final decrypted message to the console.log().

Using the test file FinalMessage.txt shows that the code works equally well om new data.
